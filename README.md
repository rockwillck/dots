# Dots
It's a dot thing

## Specifics
Randomly spawned dots float around, moving in a straight line. If they get close enough to each other, a line is drawn between them.  
It looks cool.

## Settings
You can change values in the settings menu by clicking the hamburger in the top right corner.

## Code
Dots is written using native javascript and HTML.
